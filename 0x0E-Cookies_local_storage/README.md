"Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.

Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

* When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
* Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name."
